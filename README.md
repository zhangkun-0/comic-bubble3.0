Usage instructions:

Download my ZIP package to your computer. Click the green Code button and select Download ZIP at the bottom of the menu. After downloading, unzip it locally and double-click index.html to open. (The file size is only about 50 KB.)

First, import an image — its dimensions should match the final size of your comic page. I usually place my own rough storyboard sketch here.

Ctrl + Left-click + drag = split comic panels. Drag the panel nodes to resize, and drag the panels themselves to move.

Insert a speech bubble. After selecting it, type your dialogue in the text box on the right — the layout will adjust automatically. You can merge a combo bubble with speech or thought bubbles.

Double-click inside a panel to insert an image. Right-click + drag to pan the image, use the mouse wheel to zoom, and adjust rotation with the slider on the left.

Currently, image export supports only JPG and PNG. PSD export will be available in version 4.0.
